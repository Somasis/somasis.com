= Building a commune: Mutiny
:page-description: An overview of my research tech project, Mutiny, with historical discussion.
:page-tags: [computer, mutiny]

:mutiny: https://mutiny.red/

Starting in late 2015, I had an idea for a project that had been germinating for a long time.
I wrote a back-napkin design document for the _perfect_ operating system. I called it
{mutiny}[Mutiny], because I was hoping to channel the feel of a sort of "computer revolution" that
was I felt was missing from open-source computing. An operating system for people who love their
computer. This is a blog post that I'm writing in attempt to track the history of a long-time
obsession: creating my very own Linux distribution, exactly how I want it.

:zen: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance
:fn-zen: footnote:[I really ought to read that someday. Please don't get upset if this comparison \
         doesn't make sense.]

So, this blog post will be a bit more historically inclined. I cannot tell this story just as a
story of how I came up with a cool idea, because that would be incomplete. Instead, I would like to
tell a story about growing up with Linux, learning how parts of a system work together, from rich,
complex operating systems that lay themselves bare, infatuation with philosophy, and a search for
perfection. That is to say, it's basically {zen}[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]{fn-zen}.

This will also be an unusually long blog post for me. I have never actually written down in detail
all that's been going on with regards to my open source work for the past half-decade, so this will
effectively serve as my "official" say on things. Don't worry: *this is not a post mortem*, and
I've actually been making lots of progress working towards Mutiny recently, having gotten the
toolchain and many other system components settled. Soon comes the hard work of the package manager
and init system integration.

At the beginning, I knew was was driving me: I had become infatuated with tweaking my machine to be
exactly as I want it using all the software I wanted, and I wanted none of it forced to be required.
I grew up loving Linux for the choice and the customization that it gave me as a user, but always
felt limited by the restrictions of binary distributions. My fellow Exherbo developers were and are
great, and I was often supported in my pursuits with bending the system in some way, but they also
just wanted a system that _worked_ as their daily driver. How can I argue with that?

:dev: https://git.exherbo.org/gitolite-admin.git/commit/?id=bb3484db0737b26e64d7ff4207df8930c6523185

After mastering Exherbo, eventually {dev}[I was recruited as a developer for the distribution], and
I helped to introduce musl as a basis that you could run Exherbo on. I at one point spent an entire
summer bootstrapping my Raspberry Pi to run Exherbo (with a glibc base), which if it sounds like it
took a long time... yeah, it did. I was 17 years old, and it was the first time I had ever tried to
dig into a toolchain and really figure things out.

:obsd-philo: https://www.openbsd.org/goals.html

However, I did find myself absolutely _enamoured_ with {obsd-philo}[OpenBSD's philosophy]. The idea
of one system all under the BSD license, I can take the code as I please and do (basically) whatever
with, was pretty cool to me, even though it can be argued that this "whatever" is only really taken
advantage of by shitty tech corporations. OpenBSD would soon become my gold standard for how I see
a project with clear focus, with a good set of core tenets that are worthy of imitation, and it
still is.

== Breaking away from Exherbo

Here's an email I got some time ago, via Exherbo's mailing list. It was actually well-deserved, and
it was indeed right, but the tone is funny to me. So it leads off this section.

Hello Kylie,

I'm really not happy about this commit...

:busybox: https://busybox.net/
:coreutils: https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html
:fn-virtuals: pass:q[footnote:[Virtuals, if you're not familiar, are essentially dummy packages \
              with a "provider" set for them, i.e. `virtual/man` may have `providers:mandoc` set \
              or `providers:man-db` set, because they provide equivalent functionality and don't \
              change anything at package build time. It just makes specifying dependencies easier.]]

At some point, I really started to diverge in goals from my fellow Exherbo developers. I had been
adding more "virtuals"{fn-virtuals} to Exherbo's package set, for things that were previously deemed
trivial: `wget`, `awk`, `sed`, all of these core system utilities, because I wanted to use
{busybox}[Busybox] rather than {coreutils}[GNU coreutils]. This caused some light tension, but it
was somehow enough to make me sort of snap out of my love for Exherbo. Suddenly the system was not
entirely mine; it never was, but I _felt_ as though I had free-reign, because all of my choices were
pretty safe in terms of affecting other people's systems.

:exherbo: https://exherbo.org/
:sabotage: http://sabo.xyz/
:morpheus: https://morpheus.2f30.org/
:alpine: https://alpinelinux.org/

My hope was I would take ideas I learned from {exherbo}[Exherbo], and other ideas from new
distributions springing forth, like {sabotage}[Sabotage Linux], {morpheus}[Morpheus Linux], and
likely the most notable of all, {alpine}[Alpine Linux].

Where did all these weird little distributions come from? Developers getting interested in new
technology, as usual. {musl}[musl libc], an alternative implementation of the C standard library by
Rich Felker and others was finally getting close to being a usable piece of software for the average
desktop and server administrator. {patch1}[Patches] {patch2}[would] {patch3}[still] {patch4}[be]
{patch4}[required]{fn-elfutils} {patch5}[for] {patch6}[almost] {patch7}[all] {patch8}[low-level]
{patch9}[packages], but it's surprising how far you could actually get that early on.

:bitrig: https://www.bitrig.org/

As time would have it, I was one of the developers getting interested in this new technology. Using
a system like Exherbo was something else, after years of distro-hopping from Debian, to Ubuntu,
Slackware, Arch, and so on. Nothing else scratched that itch for control, understanding, a sense of
consistency and coherency to the system. I had tried FreeBSD, OpenBSD (I even did beta-testing for
{bitrig}[Bitrig] back when they were a thing), but either due to hardware issues, a lack of
familiarity, or just a preference of Linux's chaotic style, they didn't click either.

There's a pretty consistent theme going on here so far, right? I want _control_ over my system, and
I want to be the one telling it what to run. I wanna have a system that really meshes with me in a
way that no one else could make it. So, I metaphorically packed up my bags one day. I don't remember
what day, but I decided to sketch out a design document that day.

=== Baby's First Manifesto(TM)

:cross: https://www.exherbo.org/docs/cross.html

Essentially, here is what I started with. I will be providing commentary as second-level bullet
points to the first-level points, which are extracts/paraphrases from the original design document,
or at least what I still have version-tracked and recognize as being from the original. I didn't do
version contol for the longest time when I first started working on this, but based off of IRC logs
I was able to get from friends some channels I used to frequent around the time I wrote the original
document, I believe this version, the first version, was made around August 10th, 2016.

.Propaganda
* Mutiny is a project to create a modern day open-source operating system that makes no compromises.
  Less cruft, more flexibility, suitable for any purpose desired.
    ** I really, really wanted to push this idea of that the problem I was facing was actually a
       _lack_ of flexibility; and in a way, it was. But, and this will come up later, I've since
       walked this back a bit in part due to sheer lack of manpower, and a realization of how this
       can't really coexist nicely with the BSD-style consistency.
    ** I dreamt big: Mutiny would be for your desktop, your server, your containers, whatever.
       I don't really care about that anymore, at least not as much. _Containers_? Who cares. So,
       it's not a distribution. It's a project. That mindset hasn't really changed either.

* _As of now_, it's based around the Linux kernel, musl libc, and the LLVM toolchain.
  [small]#(emphasis added for this article)#
    ** "As of now" is very important phrasing here. I wanted to follow the meta-distribution concept
       that Gentoo has going for it, and to me, that means having even these low-level components be
       able to be switched out, and mixed and matched.

* The init system that we're starting with is {s6}[s6] + {s6-rc}[s6-rc], but the goal is that the
  system will be as flexible as possible to allow for any init system, any libc, any toolchain, and
  so on.
    ** And this would come to influence all my software choices. It also contributed to another
       theme that will continue through the timeline: a lack of focus.

* No Red Hat, no GNU, no group with all the sway; an open system wit hthe interests of developers
  a spirit of work for the betterment of computing, rather than companies and foundations vying for
  the most adoption and most marketable project.
    ** There's a type of vendor lock-in that people don't really talk about as much as the general
       conception of it, and it's how groups like Red Hat basically act like they own your computer
       in 2020. There's been a lot of ink spilled about this and I'm not interested in contributing
       further to it.

.In terms of design...
* Allow for building from source _and_ using binary packages through the same process.
    ** Exherbo and Gentoo both can do this. I don't have experience with doing it in Gentoo, but
       Exherbo's way was quite clunky in my opinion and left much to be desired. The fact that there
       was no official binaries is disappointing, and usage stayed low because of it.

* Use dynamic linking for packages.
    ** This was a choice that stood in contrast to all the other "suckless" distributions floating
       around, and continues to be.

* Be secure, and harden the system by default.
    ** This was something I really got interested in from Alpine Linux and OpenBSD's record with
       leading the way in security.

:multiarch: https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/TheCaseForMultiarch
:multilib: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Multilib

* Support multiple build targets in an integrated way.
    ** This was another unusual choice. Exherbo had recently added a {cross}["cross" functionality]
       into the package repositories and the package manager. The idea in short, is that rather than
       the classic x86/amd64 division that other distributions use, such as {multiarch}[Debian's
       "multiarch"] and {multilib}[Gentoo's "multilib"], each architecture is treated as a separate
       cross-compilation target; even the host system is treated as another target. This might sound
       simple at the outset but it resulted in an overhaul of many aspects of the distribution.
       And this will come up later.

* Avoid clunky, legacy-ridden software in favor of forward-looking, slimmer, alternatives.
    ** This was not very unusual, but it influenced software selection quite a lot. This will also
       come up later.

:histopp: https://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/rants/bsd4linux/08

* Adhere to a new philosophy, influenced by BSD hacker ethic and Linux-style openness. Have
  spectacular documentation, use permissively licensed software, and there is no "base", there is no
  "ports". Decentralized programs come together to create the user's system.
    ** This was another unusual idea. Part of what made me admire BSD systems so heavily, and part
       of what continues to make me admire BSD systems is how beautifully and intricately documented
       they are. You ever just stared at the `tmux(1)` manpage? Yeah. I really wanted to create some
       sort of synthesis of these two {histopp}[historically opposite] ways of development.
    ** Permissively licensed software, for whatever reason, just hits different. It always seems to
       be so well designed. And, that satiated my desire for GPL-less, GNU-less system.

And as soon as I got done writing down a diatribe about being fed up with groups effectively
commandeering the trajectory of the entire open-source world on a whim with poor decisions like
systemd (that's right, we've finally mentioned systemd this far in), I knew exactly what the
aesthetic and _feel_ of things I was going for.
