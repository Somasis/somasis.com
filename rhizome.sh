:description: a tumblelog apprehending multitudes

*rhizome* is a tumblelog inspired by Leah Neukirchen's
https://leahneukirchen.org/trivium/[Trivium].

it mostly features links I think are cool, but might on occasion be a place for sharing things I'm
up to that donâ€™t really warrant a more fleshed out discussion.

link:rhizome.atom[subscribe] in your favorite RSS reader.
