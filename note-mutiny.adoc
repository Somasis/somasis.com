= TODO: building a commune: Mutiny
:description: an overview of my research tech project, Mutiny, with historical discussion.
:docdate: 2021-11-14
:keywords: mutiny, linux, exherbo, computing

Starting in late 2015, I had an idea for a project that had been germinating for a long time.
I wrote a back-napkin design document for the _perfect_ operating system.
And this idea has consumed me for five years now.

I called it https://mutiny.red/[Mutiny], because I was hoping to channel the feel of a sort of
"computer revolution" that was I felt was missing from open-source computing in the GitHub era.
An operating system for people who love their computer.
This is a blog post that I'm writing in attempt to track the history of a long-time obsession:
creating _my own_ distribution, a system of my making.

So, this blog post will be a bit more historically inclined. I cannot tell this story just as a
story of how I came up with a cool idea, because that would be incomplete. Instead, I would like to
tell a story about growing up with Linux, learning how parts of a system work together, from rich,
complex operating systems that lay themselves bare, infatuation with philosophy, and a search for
perfection.

That is to say, it's basically {url-zen}[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]{fn-zen}.

:fn-zen: \
    footnote:[I really ought to read that someday. \
    Please don't get upset if this comparison doesn't make sense.]

This will also be an unusually long blog post for me. I have never actually written down in detail
all that's been going on with regard to my open source work for the past half-decade, so this will
effectively serve as my "official" say on things. *This is not a post mortem*.

== Inspiration

At the beginning, I knew was was driving me: I had become infatuated with tweaking my machine to be
exactly as I want it using all the software I wanted, and I wanted none of it forced to be required.
I grew up loving Linux for the choice and the customization that it gave me as a user, but always
felt limited by the restrictions of binary distributions. My fellow Exherbo developers were and are
great, and I was often supported in my pursuits with bending the system in some way, but they also
just wanted a system that _worked_ as their daily driver. How can I argue with that?

:url-exherbo-recruit: https://git.exherbo.org/gitolite-admin.git/commit/?id=bb3484db0737b26e64d7ff4207df8930c6523185

After mastering Exherbo, eventually {url-exherbo-recruit}[I was recruited as a developer for the
distribution], and I helped to introduce musl as a basis that you could run Exherbo on.
I at one point spent an entire summer bootstrapping my Raspberry Pi to run Exherbo (with a glibc
base), which if it sounds like it took a long time... yeah, it did. I was 17 years old, and it was
the first time I had ever tried to dig into a toolchain and really figure things out.

At some point or another, I found myself absolutely _enamoured_ with OpenBSD's
https://www.openbsd.org/goals.html[philosophy].
The idea of one system all under the BSD license, I can take the code as I please and do (basically)
whatever with, was pretty cool to me, even though it can be argued that this "whatever" is only
really taken advantage of by shitty tech corporations. OpenBSD would soon become my gold standard
for how I see a project with clear focus, with a good set of core tenets that are worthy of
imitation, and it still is.

== Breaking away from Exherbo

Here's an email I got some time ago, via Exherbo's mailing list.
It was actually well-deserved, and it was indeed right, but the tone is funny to me.
So it leads off this section.

:fn-virtuals: footnote:[Virtuals, if you're not familiar, are essentially dummy packages \
    with a `provider` set for them, i.e. `virtual/man` may have `providers:mandoc` set \
    or `providers:man-db` set, because they provide equivalent functionality and don't change \
    anything at package build time. It just makes specifying dependencies easier.]

:url-gnu-coreutils: https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html

At some point, I really started to diverge in goals from my fellow Exherbo developers. I had been
adding more `virtuals`{fn-virtuals} to Exherbo's package set, for things that were previously deemed
trivial: `wget`, `awk`, `sed`, all of these core system utilities, because I wanted to use
https://busybox.net/[Busybox] rather than {url-gnu-coreutils}[GNU coreutils].
This caused some light tension, but it wasn't enough to make me snap out of my love for Exherbo.
Suddenly the system was not entirely mine; it never was, but I _felt_ as though I had free-reign,
because all of my choices were pretty safe in terms of affecting other people's systems.

My hope was I would take ideas I learned from https://exherbo.org/[Exherbo], and other ideas from
new distributions springing forth, like http://sabo.xyz/[Sabotage Linux],
https://morpheus.2f30.org/[Morpheus Linux], and the (now) most popular of them all,
https://alpinelinux.org/[Alpine Linux].

Where did all these weird little distributions come from?
Developers getting interested in new technology, as usual.
https://musl.libc.org/[musl libc], an alternative implementation of the C standard library by
Rich Felker and others was finally getting close to being a usable piece of software for the average
desktop and server administrator.

{url-patch5}[for] {url-patch6}[almost] {url-patch7}[all] {url-patch8}[low-level]
{url-patch9}[packages], but it's surprising how far you could actually get that early on.

As time would have it, I was one of the developers getting interested in this new technology.
Using a system like Exherbo was something else, after years of distro-hopping from Debian,
to Ubuntu, Slackware, Arch, and so on. Nothing else scratched that itch for control, understanding,
a sense of consistency and coherency to the system.
I had tried FreeBSD, OpenBSD (I even did beta-testing for https://www.bitrig.org/[Bitrig] back when
they were a thing), but either due to hardware issues, a lack of familiarity, or just a preference
of Linux's chaotic style, they didn't click either.

There's a pretty consistent theme going on here so far, right? I want _control_ over my system, and
I want to be the one telling it what to run. I wanna have a system that really meshes with me in a
way that no one else could make it. So, I metaphorically packed up my bags one day. I don't remember
what day, but I decided to sketch out a design document that day.

== The First Manifesto

Essentially, here is what I started with. I will be providing commentary as second-level bullet
points to the first-level points, which are extracts/paraphrases from the original design document,
or at least what I still have version-tracked and recognize as being from the original. I didn't do
version contol for the longest time when I first started working on this, but based off IRC logs
I was able to get from friends some channels I used to frequent around the time I wrote the original
document, I believe this version, the first version published, was made around August 10th, 2016.

=== Propaganda

* Mutiny is a project to create a modern day open-source operating system that makes no compromises.
  Less cruft, more flexibility, suitable for any purpose desired.
** I really, really wanted to push this idea of that the problem I was facing was actually a
   _lack_ of flexibility; and in a way, it was. But, and this will come up later (TODO), I've since
   walked this back a bit in part due to sheer lack of manpower, and a realization of how this can't
   really coexist nicely with the BSD-style consistency.
** I dreamt big: Mutiny would be for your desktop, your server, your containers, whatever.
   I don't really care about that anymore, at least not as much. _Containers_? Who cares.
   So, it's not a distribution. It's a project. That mindset hasn't really changed either.

* _As of now_, it's based around the Linux kernel, musl libc, and the LLVM toolchain.
** "As of now" is important phrasing here. I wanted to follow the meta-distribution concept
   that Gentoo has going for it, and to me, that means having even these low-level components be
   able to be switched out, and mixed and matched.

:url-s6: https://skarnet.org/software/s6/
:url-s6-rc: https://skarnet.org/software/s6-rc/
* The init system that we're starting with is {url-s6}[s6] + {url-s6-rc}[s6-rc], but the goal is
  that the system will be as flexible as possible to allow for any init system, any libc,
  any toolchain, and so on.
** And this would come to influence all my software choices.
   It also contributed to another theme that will continue through the timeline: a lack of focus.

* No Red Hat, no GNU, no group with all the sway; an open system with the interests of developers
  a spirit of work for the betterment of computing, rather than companies and foundations vying for
  the most adoption and most marketable project.
** There's a type of vendor lock-in that people don't really talk about as much as the general
   conception of it, and it's how groups like Red Hat basically act like they own your computer
   in 2020. There's been a lot of ink spilt about this and I'm not interested in contributing
   further to it.

.In terms of design...
* Allow for building from source _and_ using binary packages through the same process.
* Exherbo and Gentoo both can do this. I don't have experience with doing it in Gentoo, but
  Exherbo's way was quite clunky in my opinion and left much to be desired. The fact that there
  was no official binaries is disappointing, and usage stayed low because of it.
* Eventually, I had to give it up because it was just... too difficult for me, and I already
  was spreading myself so thin.

* Use dynamic linking for packages.
** This was a choice that stood in contrast to all the other "suckless" distributions floating
   around, and continues to be.

* Be secure, and harden the system by default.
** This was something I really got interested in from Alpine Linux and OpenBSD's record with
   leading the way in security.

:url-exherbo-cross: https://www.exherbo.org/docs/cross.html
* Support multiple build targets in an integrated way.
** This was another unusual choice.
   Exherbo had recently added a {url-exherbo-cross}[`cross` functionality] into the package
   repositories and the package manager. The idea in short, is that rather than the classic
   x86/amd64 division that other distributions use, such as [Debian's `multiarch`] and
   https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Multilib[Gentoo's `multilib`], each architecture is treated as a
   separate cross-compilation target; even the host system is treated as another target.
   This might sound simple at the outset but it resulted in an overhaul of many aspects of the
   distribution. And this will come up later. TODO

* Avoid clunky, legacy-ridden software in favor of forward-looking, slimmer, alternatives.
** This wasn't unusual, but it influenced software selection quite a lot.
   This will also come up later. TODO

:url-opposed: https://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/rants/bsd4linux/08

* Adhere to a new philosophy, influenced by BSD hacker ethic and Linux-style openness.
  Have spectacular documentation, use permissively licensed software, and there is no "base",
  there is no "ports". Decentralized programs come together to create the user's system.
** This was another unusual idea.
   Part of what made me admire BSD systems so heavily, and part of what continues to make me admire
   BSD systems is how beautifully and intricately documented they are.
   You ever just stared at the `tmux(1)` manpage? Yeah. I really wanted to create some sort of
   synthesis of these two {url-opposed}[historically opposed] ways of development.
** Permissively licensed software, for whatever reason, just hits different.
   It always seems to be so well designed.
   And, that satiated my desire for GPL-less, GNU-less system.

And as soon as I got done writing down a diatribe about being fed up with groups effectively
commandeering the trajectory of the entire open-source world on a whim with poor decisions like
systemd (that's right, we've finally mentioned systemd this far in), I knew exactly what the
aesthetic and _feel_ of things I was going for.

== Years and years of doing nothing

Mutiny is the largest project I've ever set out on.
And for a few years, I didn't do anything about it. I wrote a bunch of notes, thought about
things a lot, and generally just kept my life on my computer as it were.

When I started, I called it Mutiny, because it was something that as far as I can tell, no one was
trying to do. I still think to an extent that no one is, at least not successfully, with the depth
with which I'd like to really rethink system design. But, I still had a lot of thinking to do to get
to a point where I had a project I could really show off.

And _boy_, did 2020-2021 give me time to think.

== There is one good thing came out of the COVID-19 pandemic

With nothing _but_ time to think about computers, this has probably been the most productive year
for Mutiny since this mess started.

*TODO: i have a lot more to write*
