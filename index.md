## About me

My name is Kylie McClain.

Since joining Exherbo I've became more interested in system administration and
system integrating, and hope to pursue system administration as a career. My plans
are to go to college majoring in system administration and minoring in audio
engineering.

## Things of note

- [musl-wiki], a wiki documenting the musl libc
- [Exherbo Linux], I was recruited as a developer in May 2015
    - Implemented support for [musl libc]. [x86_64-pc-linux-musl] <3
    - [Working] towards making the system run with [permissively-licensed]
      components whenever possible.
    - Redesigned website to look more modern, and be responsive to different
      devices.
    - I maintain a [distfiles mirror].
    - [musl-compat], compatibility headers and utilities for musl libc systems
- [lux], a Linux kernel updater
- [git-gerrit], a non-interactive Gerrit interface

### Old projects
