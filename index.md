## About me

My name is Kylie McClain, and I am a 17 year old woman. I have been using
computers since I was about three years old, and using Linux since age seven. I
get a lot of joy out helping people do what they want to do, and I have a lot of
fun finding solutions to problems. A lot of my time nowadays is spent working on
Exherbo Linux, which I was recruited as a developer for on May 12th, 2015.

I've held interest in old video games since I was a young kid, being that weird
kid that talked about glitches in NES emulators while my friends wondered what I
was even saying. My love for video games has waned over the years, but I still
appreciate them for an artful aspect.

Some of my favorite musicians are Aphex Twin, Venetian Snares, Squarepusher, The
Flashbulb, and The Meters. My music tends to go between breakcore, and
instrumental hip-hop something. I like to think I keep it fairly eclectic, and
try to be varied in my influences and creations.
