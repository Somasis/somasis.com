### Old projects

Old means I don't really actively work on them anymore. The projects probably
still work but you might want to learn how to work on them yourself.

- [Exherbo Linux], I was recruited as a developer in May 2015
    - Implemented support for [musl libc]. [x86_64-pc-linux-musl] <3
    - Implemented replacing some GNU components with minimalist/embedded-oriented
      alternatives; `coreutils` for `busybox`
    - Redesigned website to look more modern, and be responsive to different
      devices.
    - I maintain a [distfiles mirror].
- [musl-compat], compatibility headers and utilities for musl libc systems
- [Bootstrapped], a clean tumblr theme
- [beginning], an init system no smarter than me or you
- [gnome-colors-revival], [shiki-colors-revival], [arc-colors-revival],
  maintained versions of the "GNOME Colors" suite of themes
