lookie:

* [catclock](https://github.com/BarkyTheDog/catclock), an adorable xclock fork with a cat...
* [unix50.org](https://unix50.org/) lets you ssh into old UNIX systems going all the way back to
  UNICS, from the summer of '69.
* [The Unix Command Language](https://susam.github.io/tucl/the-unix-command-language.html), the
  first paper ever published about the Unix shell. written by a certain ken thompson in 1976.
* [usand](https://github.com/richfelker/usand), an unshare(1)-based sandbox.

things I'm up to:

* I started this lil blog thing.

* I got ahold of [The C Programming Language][k&r] and [21st Century C][21c], and I'll hopefully be
  reading it while working on some C utilities for some Mutiny work. I've got some vague experience
  working with C when it comes to patching other people's projects, but not much in terms of
  writing from scratch.

* Hopefully I will participate in [Advent of Code][aoc] for the first time this year?
